# Eval log

Rules: tasks in a registration are never edited. Ranking, tokenization, and synonym changes are recorded here with before/after retrieval. New tasks are added only as a new, dated registration.

## 2026-09-13 — Registration 1

20 app-builder intents registered in `eval/tasks.json` before any `src/search/` code existed. Golden components were chosen from knowledge of Primer React, without running search.
